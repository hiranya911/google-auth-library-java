This project consists of 3 artifacts:

-  [*google-auth-library-credentials*](#google-auth-library-credentials): contains base classes and
interfaces for Google credentials
-  [*google-auth-library-appengine*](#google-auth-library-appengine): contains App Engine
credentials. This artifacts depends on the App Engine SDK
-  [*google-auth-library-oauth2-http*](#google-auth-library-oauth2-http): contains a wide variety of
credentials as well as utility methods to create them and to get Application Default Credentials

> Note: This client is a work-in-progress, and may occasionally
> make backwards-incompatible changes.

Quickstart
----------

If you are using Maven, add this to your pom.xml file (notice that you can replace
`google-auth-library-oauth2-http` with any of `google-auth-library-credentials` and
`google-auth-library-appengine`, depending on your application needs):
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.auth</groupId>
  <artifactId>google-auth-library-oauth2-http</artifactId>
  <version>0.9.0</version>
</dependency>
```
If you are using Gradle, add this to your dependencies
```Groovy
compile 'com.google.auth:google-auth-library-oauth2-http:0.9.0'
```
If you are using SBT, add this to your dependencies
```Scala
libraryDependencies += "com.google.auth" % "google-auth-library-oauth2-http" % "0.9.0"
```

google-auth-library-credentials
-------------------------------

This artifact contains base classes and interfaces for Google credentials:
- `Credentials`: base class for an authorized identity. Implementations of this class can be used to
authorize your application
- `RequestMetadataCallback`: interface for the callback that receives the result of the asynchronous
`Credentials.getRequestMetadata(URI, Executor, RequestMetadataCallback)`
- `ServiceAccountSigner`: interface for a service account signer. Implementations of this class are
capable of signing byte arrays using the credentials associated to a Google Service Account

google-auth-library-appengine
-----------------------------
This artifact depends on the App Engine SDK (`appengine-api-1.0-sdk`) and should be used only by
applications running on App Engine. The `AppEngineCredentials` class allows to authorize your App
Engine application given an instance of [AppIdentityService](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/javadoc/com/google/appengine/api/appidentity/AppIdentityService).

google-auth-library-oauth2-http
-------------------------------

This artifact contains a wide variety of credentials as well as utility methods to create them and
to get Application Default Credentials.
Credentials classes contained in this artifact are:
- `CloudShellCredentials`: credentials for Google Cloud Shell built-in service account
- `CloudShellCredentials`: credentials for Google Compute Engine built-in service account
- `OAuth2Credentials`: base class for OAuth2-based credentials
- `ServiceAccountCredentials`: credentials for a Service Account - use a JSON Web Token (JWT) to get
access tokens
- `ServiceAccountJwtAccessCredentials`: credentials for a Service Account - use JSON Web Token (JWT)
directly in the request metadata to provide authorization
- `UserCredentials`: credentials for a user identity and consent

To get Application Default Credentials use `GoogleCredentials.getApplicationDefault()` or
`GoogleCredentials.getApplicationDefault(HttpTransportFactory)`. These methods return the
Application Default Credentials which are used to identify and authorize the whole application. The
following are searched (in order) to find the Application Default Credentials:

1. Credentials file pointed to by the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable
2. Credentials provided by the Google Cloud SDK `gcloud auth application-default login` command
3. Google App Engine built-in credentials
4. Google Cloud Shell built-in credentials
5. Google Compute Engine built-in credentials
   - Skip this check by setting the environment variable `NO_GCE_CHECK=true`
   - Customize the GCE metadata server address by setting the environment variable `GCE_METADATA_HOST=<hostname>`

To get Credentials from a Service Account JSON key use `GoogleCredentials.fromStream(InputStream)`
or `GoogleCredentials.fromStream(InputStream, HttpTransportFactory)`.
